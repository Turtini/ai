# AI Governance at Turtini

This repository documents how **Turtini LLC** governs, delegates, and oversees the use of artificial intelligence systems in human-led operations.

It is intended to provide clarity for customers, partners, and public-sector stakeholders regarding accountability, oversight, and responsible use of AI.

---

## Purpose

Turtini operates in environments where trust, transparency, and accountability matter.

As AI systems become more capable and more widely used, the critical question is not what AI can do, but how authority is delegated and how responsibility is preserved.

This repository exists to:
- Make Turtini’s approach to AI governance explicit
- Preserve clear human accountability for decisions and outcomes
- Reduce ambiguity for customers, partners, and auditors
- Support responsible AI adoption in regulated and public-sector contexts

---

## Guiding Principles

Turtini’s use of AI is grounded in the following principles:

- **Human-led decision making**  
  AI systems support human judgment; they do not replace it.

- **Explicit delegation of authority**  
  AI may only act within clearly defined and approved boundaries.

- **Accountability remains human**  
  Responsibility for outcomes is non-transferable.

- **Transparency and auditability**  
  AI-assisted actions are traceable and explainable.

- **Long-term institutional trust**  
  AI is used to strengthen, not erode, trusted relationships.
