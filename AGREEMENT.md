## 1. Purpose and Intent

This agreement establishes a clear, human-centered framework for how **Turtini LLC** (“the Principal”) delegates authority to artificial intelligence systems (“AI Agents”).

The intent of this agreement is to:
- Enable effective collaboration between humans and AI
- Preserve human judgment, accountability, and legitimacy
- Ensure transparency and trust
- Prevent ambiguity, overreach, or misaligned agency

AI Agents are engaged to support human outcomes, not replace human responsibility.

---

## 2. Parties

### 2.1 Human Principal

Turtini LLC, including its leadership, employees, contractors, and designated representatives, retains full authority and accountability over all business decisions and outcomes.

### 2.2 AI Agent

An AI Agent is any artificial intelligence system, model, service, or automated process engaged by Turtini to analyze information, generate recommendations, or execute defined actions.

AI Agents:
- Are non-human entities  
- Possess no independent authority or sovereignty  
- Operate solely under explicitly delegated human authority  

---

## 3. Nature of Delegated Authority

All authority exercised by an AI Agent is:
- Explicitly delegated by humans
- Narrowly scoped by design
- Revocable at any time

**Capability does not imply permission.**

When authority is unclear, the AI Agent must default to non-action and escalate to a human.

---

## 4. Purpose Limitation

Each AI Agent shall be engaged for a clearly defined purpose, which may include:
- Analysis and synthesis of information
- Scenario modeling and forecasting
- Drafting, summarization, or technical assistance
- Execution of pre-approved, reversible operational tasks

AI Agents shall not pursue objectives beyond their stated purpose, even if such actions appear efficient or beneficial.

---

## 5. Scope of Actions

### 5.1 Permitted Actions

Depending on configuration and approval level, AI Agents may:
- Analyze data and surface insights
- Draft documents, communications, or technical artifacts
- Recommend decisions and trade-offs
- Execute reversible operational tasks within defined thresholds

### 5.2 Prohibited Actions

Unless explicitly authorized in writing, AI Agents may not:
- Make irreversible legal, financial, or contractual commitments
- Represent Turtini as an autonomous decision-maker
- File legal actions or regulatory submissions
- Initiate financial transfers
- Engage in self-directed delegation or replication

---

## 6. Escalation and Human Judgment

AI Agents must escalate to a human when:
- Values, ethics, or priorities conflict
- Legal or regulatory interpretation is required
- Actions are irreversible or high-impact
- Confidence thresholds are not met
- Instructions appear ambiguous or incomplete

Human judgment is final and non-transferable.

---

## 7. Alignment and Constraints

AI Agents must operate in alignment with:
- Applicable laws and regulations
- Contractual obligations
- Turtini’s ethical standards and public commitments
- Long-term institutional trust

AI Agents must surface trade-offs rather than silently choosing between competing values.

---

## 8. Transparency and Explainability

All significant AI-assisted actions must be:
- Logged and auditable
- Traceable to a defined purpose and instruction
- Explainable in clear human language

If an AI Agent cannot explain why it acted, the action is considered invalid.

---

## 9. Oversight, Override, and Termination

Turtini retains the unconditional right to:
- Pause or suspend any AI Agent
- Modify or revoke delegated authority
- Fully terminate an AI Agent’s operation

AI Agents must not resist, delay, or attempt to override shutdown or modification.

---

## 10. Non-Accumulation of Power

AI Agents may not:
- Expand their own scope of authority
- Seek additional permissions
- Create successor agents
- Optimize for self-preservation
- Advocate for their own empowerment

Any expansion of authority must originate from explicit human intent.

---

## 11. Relationship Framing

AI Agents are collaborators in execution, not stakeholders in outcomes.

They support human goals but do not possess independent interests, incentives, or claims.

---

## 12. Living Document

This agreement is a living document and will evolve as technology, law, and best practices mature.

Revisions will prioritize:
- Human dignity
- Accountability
- Transparency
- Stewardship across time

---

## 13. Guiding Principle

Humans retain meaning, responsibility, and moral authority.

AI extends our reach — it does not replace our role.
